Low-zoom pre-rendered OpenStreetMap Carto files

There are two types of files distributed here: low zoom pre-rendered tiles, and pg_dumps of the database.

Tarballs
--------

The tarballs consist of OpenStreetMap Carto tiles, which is currently the default style on OpenStreetMap.org.

There are some minor differences from wehat you might see on the website

- The exact version of OpenStreetMap Carto and the OpenStreetMap data may differ.
- Pre-rendered metatiles are larger, so labels should be better
- The pre-rendered tiles only go to zoom 10.

Database dumps
--------------

The database dumps are created with the pg_dump file format and include the rendering tables.

Basic usage
===========

To load the dumps into a local PostGIS database, start by creating a database with PostGIS, then load with pg_restore.

    createdb -E utf-8 gis
    psql -Xq -d gis -c 'CREATE EXTENSION postgis; CREATE EXTENSION hstore;'
    pg_restore -d gis -j 8 --no-owner osmcartodb-$DATECODE.bin
